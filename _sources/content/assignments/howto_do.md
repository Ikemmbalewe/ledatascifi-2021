# Homework guidelines

## Starting homework

1. **Click on the assignment link in coursesite.** When you follow the link and accept the assignment, GitHub will create a repo for you. The repo will be a private repo (only you, me, and the TA can see it) under the LeDataSciFi organization on GitHub. Inside the repo will be the README.md file (with instructions and the rubric you will be graded on) and possibly starter code/data.
2. Clone the repo to your local machine using GitHub desktop. 

## Working on assignments / projects / taking notes 

```{dropdown} 1. Make your coffee, open Github Desktop, and fetch the project you'll work on. 
1. Change the "current repository" to the assignment you want to work on (or project, or your notes repo, etc.)
1. Click "Fetch origin" to download any changes from the master repo on the Github servers. This is important, because if someone else changed the files while you were sleeping, you'll get the most updated files to work on. 
1. Start your work on your computer.

```{dropdown} 2. **FREQUENTLY** (say every 30 minutes or so, but depends on the team/task): 
- Save the files you're working on. (Just like you would while working on a Powerpoint or Word document.) 
- When you save the file, Github Desktop (GHD) will notice it has been changed. 
- Go to GDH. Notice that your file is listed as a "changed" file. 
- **Describe those changes in the "Summary" and (optionally) "Description" boxes, and click the blue "Commit" button**. 
- Try to do this every time you save your files! It will make rolling back changes easier. 
- **Do this early and often**
```

```{dropdown} 3. **OFTEN** (say every 60-90 minutes or so, but depends on the team/task): 
You should push your changes to the cloud right? (Both as a backup and also so teammates can see the changes and work with the latest files.)
