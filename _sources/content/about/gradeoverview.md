```{epigraph}
Just tell me about grades already.

-- You, probably
```

```{epigraph}
Ok, fine... Here is the high level overview of grades.

-- Me, defeated

^^^

```{tabbed}  Participation (20%)
From most important to slightly less important:
- Discussion board (answering questions and/or moving conversations forward, being helpful and polite)
- Presenting pre-class exercise attempts (good faith attempts)
- Attendance and in class contributions to discussions
```

```{tabbed} Assignments (40%)
A few notes:
- Later assignments will receive larger grade components
- Each assignment grade will come from an average of two peer reviews (adjusted for objective errors in reviews and large subjective ones)
- Unless explicitly noted, all assignments must be completed individually. 
```

```{tabbed}  Peer review (20%)
You should aspire to 
- Write accurate and honest reviews
- Actually ran the code to verify accuracy
- Give helpful, constructive, and nice feedback
```

```{tabbed}  Final Project (20%)
It's going to be fun!

```
