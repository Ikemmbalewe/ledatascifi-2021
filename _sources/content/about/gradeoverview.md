^^^

```{tabbed} 20% Participation
From most important to slightly less important:
- Discussion board (answering questions and/or moving conversations forward, being helpful and polite)
- Presenting pre-class exercise attempts (good faith attempts)
- Attendance and in class contributions to discussions
```

```{tabbed} 40% Assignments
- Later assignments will receive larger grade components
- Each assignment grade will come from an average of two peer reviews (adjusted for objective errors in reviews and large subjective ones)
- Unless explicitly noted, all assignments must be completed individually. 
```

```{tabbed} 20% Peer review
- Accurate and honest reviews
- Actually ran the code to verify accuracy
- Helpful, constructive, and nice feedback
```

```{tabbed} 20% Final Project
Details to come!
