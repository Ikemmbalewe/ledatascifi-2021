## How to succeed, practical matters, and expectations for class

To achieve those objectives, we will have class meetings at the scheduled times. This course will be, in essence, "pseudo flipped." Meetings will be a mix of lecture, live demo, discussion, pair programming, code races, and tiny student presentations of pre-class problems. I'll tell you more as we move along, but I'm striving to make class sessions productive and interesting throughout. 

In addition, you will have as resources this website, your peers via a github discussion board, the whole of the internet, and, naturally, office hours. **Which is to say: You have my utmost support, and you will succeed if you put in the time!**


```{note}
While this class is remote, I will hold 5+ (optional) live get-togethers on campus during the semester. I'm looking forward to these, provided we can do so safely. I'll make announcements in advance.

### Meeting times

We're sticking with the registrar's times for zoom meetings, listed below. If you need to attend the other one for any reason, please email me.

### Practical matters and expectations

```{warning}
This is important - please read!
```

TODO this entire section is outdated

Interaction in the course will be 
1. Standard class meetings will take place in zoom

- two monitors will make it so much easier (no other costs for this class)
- PLS use headphones!
- my policy on record is not settled. Some sessions, and parts of some sessions, will not be recorded for privacy concerns. ANy records I make will be deleted within 2 weeks, so don't fall behind!
- download latest zoom client (update) to have access to more poll and breakout features
- todo new attendance policy

- **I expect students to attend all classes.** It is crucial to learning the content in this class, but also for hearing announcements and course changes. _Remember: This class is brand new, so things are liable to change. If you don't attend class, you will be off guard or unaware of developments I announce verbally._ 
- **Please bring your laptops to class\*.**[^outdated] This will be a very hands-on course, with relatively little in the way of formal theory. Instead, we’ll be working through lecture notes together in class and you’ll be running code on your own machines. 
- **Participation is essential for understanding and integrating the material.** All students should be willing to volunteer answers, speculation, and argue for different approaches. Students should engage with hypotheticals in discussions, and be working on the code of the moment when called. Participation grade is based on: (1) submitted codes developed during class, (2) preparation when cold-called, and (3) volunteering answers. Please don't over-volunteer: I will cap credit at some point. 
- **The whole class is run off this website and GitHub. GitHub is how we'll submit assignments, provide feedback, receive grades, etc.**  You'll learn how this works as the semester proceeds. 
- **Free and open-source:** All resources and software required for this course.
- "_**Taking a step back, one of the goals of this course is to make you aware of the incredible array of instruction material that is freely available online.** I also want to encourage you to be entrepreneurial. In that spirit, many of the lectures will follow a tutorial on someone’s blog tutorial, or involve reproducing an existing study with open source tools._" -Grant McDermott
- **Group work:**  I'll describe this when the time comes.
- Unless explicitly noted, all assignments must be completed individually. Changes to submissions after the deadline will be ignored, and missed assignments will receive a zero. 


[^outdated]: Well... I guess this policy is redundant this year.
