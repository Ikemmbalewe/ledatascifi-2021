## Acknowledgments 

In addition to sites listed in the [resources](resources), this course draws on great work from many, many people. Special thanks to:
- The [STAT545](https://stat545.stat.ubc.ca) course at UBC initially developed by Jenny Bryan and its [companion site](https://happygitwithr.com/) detailing how to set up a Git/Github workflow with R was the key inspiration.
- The [Python Data Science Notebook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/) 
- Grant McDermott's [EC607](https://github.com/uo-ec607/lectures) course at Oregon
