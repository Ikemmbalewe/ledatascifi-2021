# Homework guidelines

## Starting homework

1. **Click on the assignment link in coursesite.** When you follow the link and accept the assignment, GitHub will create a repo for you. The repo will be a private repo (only you, me, and the TA can see it) under the LeDataSciFi organization on GitHub. Inside the repo will be the README.md file (with instructions and the rubric you will be graded on) and possibly starter code/data.
2. Clone the repo to your local machine using GitHub desktop. 

## Working on assignments / projects / taking notes 

```{dropdown} 1. Make your coffee and open Github Desktop.
1. Change the "current repository" to the assignment you want to work on (or project, or your notes repo, etc.)
1. Click "Fetch origin" to download any changes from the master repo on the Github servers (just in case a change was made by others).

```{dropdown} 2. Do some work on your computer. 
1. Frequently: Save the files you're working on. (Just like you would while working on a Powerpoint or Word document.) 
     - When you save the file, Github Desktop (GHD) will notice it has been changed. 
     - GO to GDH. Notice that your file is listed as a "changed" file. 
     - In GHD, describe those changes in the "Summary" and (optionally) "Description" boxes. Click the blue "Commit" button so that GHD can associate your summary with those specific changes.
