# Homework guidelines

## Starting homework

1. **Click on the assignment link in coursesite.** When you follow the link and accept the assignment, GitHub will create a repo for you. The repo will be a private repo (only you, me, and the TA can see it) under the LeDataSciFi organization on GitHub. Inside the repo will be the README.md file (with instructions and the rubric you will be graded on) and possibly starter code/data.
2. Clone the repo to your local machine using GitHub desktop.
