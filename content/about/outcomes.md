_"This class is the real deal - it teaches you the skills you need to succeed at solving data-driven problems. The course has a brilliant focus on practicality, and all of the things you'll be doing here are being used today in the real world. I've used the skills I developed in this course probably over a dozen times since the class finished, including both personal projects and 400-level CSE courses, and it's opened up a huge number of doors for me professionally._ 

_"The job market is only getting more and more competitive, and having Python with a collection of popular data science tools at your disposal will help you stand out tremendously. If there's one thing that the pandemic has shown us, it's that the technology will only continue to grow in importance - and by taking this class, you're putting yourself on the right side of that curve."_

_"Fin 377 was undoubtedly the most interesting and useful class I took at Lehigh. I began the class with essentially no coding background, and finished with the skills to text scrape 10-K's, build regression models, a strong understanding of packages such as pandas and numpy, in addition to a finished research data science project that I've been able to leverage in every interview I've had since (regardless of the type of firm). This class inspired me to pursue a Master's in Financial Mathematics at UChicago, where these skills have been instrumental to my success. In fact, I have used them in every single class I have taken so far! As I had no coding experience going in, Fin 377 was challenging, but in a rewarding, inspiring, and exciting sense. If you put in the work, you will emerge from this class with an abundance of quantitative skills that are key within the industry."_"

_"FIN377 prepared me for much of what I have been asked to work on in my masters program, and provided me with core skills that have allowed me to excel in many of my analytics classes. Even more crucial, the course's projects have allowed me to speak intelligently about data science and analytics in interviews with prestigious investment, consulting, and financial technology firms. I can confidently say, the class is one of the most rewarding offered at Lehigh."_

_"I came into the class with some experience with coding, but with very limited knowledge of Python. However, after leaving this class, I had a much firmer grasp on the program and how to use it to my benefit. I especially enjoyed how this class was so interactive and relied upon working with my peers. From day 1 in my real-world job in the financial products analytics field, I realized just how valuable this knowledge can be, especially since data analytics and coding is our worldâ€™s future!."_"
