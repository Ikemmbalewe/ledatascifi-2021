    "1. Create a participation repo on GitHub (you can create a new one, fork or clone an existing one, or for assignments - be invited to one). If it's brand new, make sure to initialize the repo with a README. There is a [gif here showing me opening a new repo](https://ledatascifi.github.io/participation/participation.html#setup).\n",

    "Now, every time you want to work on the project:\n",
    "1. Pull the existing master repo into your local repo on your computer (just in case a change was made by others). GitHub Desktop calls this operation a \"**fetch**\" and Git calls this a \"**pull**\".\n",
    "1. Work on the project in the local repo (on your computer). \n",
    "2. \"**Stage**\" the files to tell Git about those changes. GitHub Desktop automatically sees changes to files in the local repo when you save them and automatically “stages” them, by listing them as “changed” files in the left part of the screen. (Nice!)\n",
    "3. \"**Commit**\" to the changes to tell Git, \"yes, I want to do this, and what I did was \\[describe the changes\\]\". In GitHub Desktop, this means adding a short summary and (optionally) a longer description. Then click the **\"Commit to master\"** buttom. **Do this early and often!!!**\n",
    "5. You’re almost ready to push the changes to cloud, but not yet! What if someone else (or you on a different machine) made changes to the master repo? Prevent issues by doing this step: \"**fetch**\"/\"**pull**\" from the master repo. (On GitHub Desktop for Windows, you click the \"repository\" menu and then \"Pull\".) If there are any conflicts, you’ll be notified and prompted to fix them. If there are conflicts, fix them!\n",
