How to turn these `ipynb` files into slides:

One at a time:

```
cd C:\Users\DonsLaptop\Desktop\GitHub\ledatascifi-2021
jupyter nbconvert "L1_intro_github.ipynb" --to slides 
```

A second option that might be nice to have is a terminal file that automatically runs that for all `.ipynb` files in this folder. Something to do later...
